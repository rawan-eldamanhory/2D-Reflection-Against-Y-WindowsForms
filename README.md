# 2D Reflection Against Y-Axis (Windows Forms)

This project is a **Windows Forms application** that demonstrates the concept of **2D geometric reflection against the Y-axis** using C# and GDI+ graphics.

## 🖼 Project Overview
The application draws a triangle on the screen and then displays its reflection across the Y-axis using basic geometric transformations.

## 📌 Concepts Covered
- 2D Reflection
- Coordinate transformations
- Reflection against Y-axis
- Drawing shapes using GDI+ (`Graphics`)
- Windows Forms rendering

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C#
- Windows Forms
- GDI+ Graphics

## ▶️ How It Works
1. A triangle is defined using 2D coordinates.
2. The original shape is drawn on the form.
3. Reflection is applied by negating the X-coordinates around a reference axis.
4. The reflected shape is drawn using a different color.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open `WindowsFormsApp1.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Build the solution
3. Run the application
4. Observe the original and reflected shapes

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding 2D reflection against the Y-axis
- Applying geometric transformations
- Using Windows Forms for graphical visualization
